# ONLINE COURSE PLATFORM 

   ## This is to bring an MVP for the online course platform solution
   
### Booking Services
  We have three micro services written for this booking system
  * Auth/User Service
  * Course Service
  * Adapter Service
 
 Added architecture diagram in the module
  
# Improvements needed
   * Logging 
   * Swagger documentation inclusion
   * Add url to property file or in db
   * Jmeter for load testing
   * And most important Unit Test
   * user based authentication has to be implemented

# Note

   This is not a perfect solution . Myself admit it!
   
   * I have left some business senarios due to time shortage
   * For API security, still we have N number of systems in the market like supertoken.ai, other frameworks and more, but due to time constraints I achieved by introducing the token system (as another microservice)
